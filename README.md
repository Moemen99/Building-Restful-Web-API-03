## Introduction

An API (Application Programming Interface) serves as a bridge between different applications, enabling them to communicate and share data efficiently. Think of it as a digital contract that defines how two applications should interact with each other.

## What is an API?

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Client] -->|Request| B[API]
    B -->|Request| C[Server]
    C -->|Response| B
    B -->|Response| A
```

An API is:
- A contract between applications
- An interface for data transfer
- A standardized way of communication
- A middleware that handles requests and responses

## How APIs Work

Consider this restaurant analogy:
- **Customer (Client)** - Places an order
- **Waiter (API)** - Takes the order to the kitchen
- **Kitchen (Server)** - Processes the order
- **Waiter (API)** - Delivers the finished order back to the customer

| Component | Role | Example |
|-----------|------|---------|
| Client | Sends requests | Mobile app, website, desktop application |
| API | Handles communication | RESTful endpoints, GraphQL interface |
| Server | Processes requests | Database operations, business logic |

## Real-World Examples

### Sports Results Application
1. Central API stores match results
2. Multiple platforms consume the data:
   - Web browsers
   - Mobile applications
   - Digital displays
3. Real-time updates through API calls

### E-commerce Platform
```mermaid

    A[E-commerce API] --> B[Web Application]
    A --> C[iOS App]
    A --> D[Android App]
    A --> E[Third-party Integrations]
```

## Benefits of Using APIs

1. **Efficiency**
   - Single codebase for core functionality
   - Reduced development time
   - Easier maintenance

2. **Consistency**
   - Uniform data delivery
   - Standardized communication
   - Reliable integration points

3. **Scalability**
   - Easy to add new clients
   - Centralized updates
   - Platform independence

4. **Development Benefits**
   - Separation of concerns
   - Modular architecture
   - Simplified debugging

## Comparison: Traditional vs API-Based Architecture

| Aspect | Traditional Approach | API-Based Approach |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Code Management | Multiple codebases | Single codebase |
| Updates | Need to update each platform | Update once at API level |
| Integration | Complex, platform-specific | Standardized across platforms |
| Maintenance | Higher effort | Lower effort |
| Scalability | Limited | Highly scalable |

## Best Practices

1. **Documentation**
   - Clear endpoints description
   - Request/response examples
   - Error handling guidelines

2. **Security**
   - Authentication
   - Authorization
   - Data encryption

3. **Performance**
   - Caching strategies
   - Rate limiting
   - Response optimization

# Creating ASP.NET Core Web API Project
## Setting up SurveyBasket Solution

### Step 1: Create New Project
1. Open Visual Studio
2. Click "Create a new project"
3. Search and select "ASP.NET Core Web API"

### Step 2: Configure Project Settings
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Project Configuration] --> B[Solution Name: SurveyBasket]
    A --> C[Project Name: SurveyBasket.Api]
    A --> D[Location: Your chosen path]
```

### Step 3: Configure Additional Settings
| Setting | Value | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| Framework | .NET Core | The target framework for the application |
| Authentication | None | No authentication scheme selected initially |
| HTTPS | ✓ Checked | Configure HTTPS for secure communication |
| OpenAPI/Swagger | ✓ Checked | Enable API documentation and testing |
| Controllers | ✓ Checked | Use controller-based API endpoints |

### Project Structure Overview
```

├── SurveyBasket.sln
└── SurveyBasket.Api/
    ├── Controllers/
    ├── Properties/
    ├── appsettings.json
    ├── appsettings.Development.json
    ├── Program.cs
    └── WeatherForecast.cs
```

## Key Components
1. **Controllers folder**: Contains API endpoint definitions
2. **Program.cs**: Application entry point and configuration
3. **appsettings.json**: Application configuration files
4. **WeatherForecast.cs**: Example model class

## Next Steps
1. Add necessary NuGet packages
2. Configure application settings
3. Create models and controllers
4. Set up database connectivity
5. Implement business logic

---
**Note**: The created project includes a sample WeatherForecast controller and model which can be used as reference or removed as needed.

```

## Project Components

### Dependencies
1. **Packages**
   - NuGet packages (e.g., Swagger)
   - Third-party libraries
   
2. **Project References**
   - References to other project layers
   - External project dependencies

├── Properties/
│   └── launchSettings.json
├── Controllers/
├── appsettings.json
├── appsettings.Development.json
├── Program.cs
└── WeatherForecast.cs
```

## Launch Settings Configuration

### launchSettings.json
This file is **development-only** and not included in deployment.

```json
{
  "profiles": {
    "http": {
      "commandName": "Project",
      "launchBrowser": true,
      "launchUrl": "swagger",
      "environmentVariables": {
        "ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT": "Development"
      },
      "applicationUrl": "http://localhost:5000"
    },
    "https": {
      "commandName": "Project",
      "launchBrowser": true,
      "launchUrl": "swagger",
      "environmentVariables": {
        "ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT": "Development"
      },
      "applicationUrl": "https://localhost:5001;http://localhost:5000"
    },
    "IIS Express": {
      "commandName": "IISExpress",
      "launchBrowser": true,
      "launchUrl": "swagger"
    }
  }
}
```

### Profile Types

| Profile | Description | URL Configuration |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| HTTP | Basic HTTP profile | Single HTTP URL |
| HTTPS | Secure HTTPS profile | HTTPS URL with HTTP redirect |
| IIS Express | IIS-specific configuration | Uses IIS Settings with HTTPS redirect |

### Key Settings Explained
1. **Launch Browser**
   - `"launchBrowser": true` - Opens browser automatically
   - `"launchUrl": "swagger"` - Opens Swagger UI

2. **Environment Variables**
   - Development-specific settings
   - Configuration for local development

3. **Application URLs**
   - HTTP: Single port configuration
   - HTTPS: Dual ports with redirect
   - IIS Express: Custom IIS configuration

### Development vs. Deployment
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Launch Settings] --> B[Development Machine]
    C[Server Configuration] --> D[Deployment Environment]
```

| Environment | Configuration Source |
|-------------|---------------------|
| Development | launchSettings.json |
| Production | Server Configuration |

## Running the Application
1. Select desired profile from Visual Studio
2. Application launches with:
   - Command window showing port information
   - Browser opening to Swagger UI
   - HTTPS redirect if configured

---
**Note**: The launchSettings.json file is crucial for development but never deployed to production, where server configurations take precedence.
